Dear Hiring,

Please accept my resume for the Software Engineer Systems intern position at Infinera. I am a full-time student at San Jose State University, pursuing M.S in Computer Engineering with a GPA of 3.85 and I am eligible to work as an intern. I would like to be a part of the engineering team at Infinera and use my knowledge and expertise in Software Development to solve complex problems in the filed of engineering.

Having extensively studied operating systems, data structures and computer architecture in the first semester, I have clear understanding of linux processes and kernel modules and their interfacing with the system architecture. I worked on a team project to design a Linux file system implemented in userspace using netlink sockets for IPC between user and kernel space. This project helped me gain deep understanding of virtual file system which acts as an interface to all file systems in Linux. This also encouraged me to develop a simpler protocol for IPC between kernel and user space using procfs. As part of the curriculum in my current semester, I am studying socket programming in C, C++ and JAVA and working on a term project to develop a file replication daemon to replicate text files on to server daemons with features like fault tolerance, encryption and compression. 

I have previously worked with Infosys Technologies, Ltd as a systems engineer where I also gained relevant industry experience for more than 2 years. Currently working at Spartan Shops IT Services as an IT coordinator, I manage a team of four technicians to coordinate IT support and service operations reducing time to service user requests and increase customer satisfaction. I am also learning shell and Python for scripting as it will enhance my skill set.

I look forward to hear from you to discuss further about how I can contribute to the development of software tools for Infinera. This job will be a perfect extension for my career.
I can be reached at (408)571-8995 or ankit.khani@sjsu.edu
